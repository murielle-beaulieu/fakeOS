## Requirements / Purpose

  - The menu is positioned in the appropriate place (bottom left on windows, top of the screen on android)
  - "App" looks consistent
  - Menu contains a flex with content inside it
  - "App" should use an external API

  JavaScript
  - Put your js code into separate files
  - Your icons and menu should add event listener for the click event, don't use the html onclick attribute
